                "Angela is just incredible, awesome and just fantastic in this course. I've never had such an instructor; detailed in every aspect of the course, gives precise explanations, gives you the anxiety to learn etc. She's got that ability to make fun while explaining things for better understanding. I really love this course." - Ekeu MonkamUlrich
                
                "Angela is very thorough without ever being boring. I've taken MANY online courses in my life including my Bachelors and Masters degrees. She is by far the best instructor I've ever had. This course is packed with thousands of dollars worth of great instruction, and paced well enough for anyone to pick coding up and run with it- Thank you!" - J Carlucci
                
                "Love the way Angela explains things. Easy to follow and full of logic.</p>
                <p> I can say she must have spent a lot of energy creating this great course. Thank you and I recommend it to all who's interested in coding!" - Yiqing Zheng
                
                "So far (on my third day) this course has taught me more than I was able to learn in multiple other programming courses. This course is clearly outlined and builds upon itself gradually in an easy to understand way." - Normal Ramsey
                
                "This course will take you from beginner to intermediate level for real. If you don't know how to put together the pieces of web development this is what you're looking for. Angela explains in an amazing way by creating projects all the way during this course, explaining the concepts in real practice. Thank you very much, Angela. I will always consider you my mentor. Look forward to taking more courses with you." - Moises Dionisio Cruz</p>
